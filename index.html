        <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to writing you may have struggled. Wether it's from hitting a writer's block to even knowing how to end your story or trying to make the character likeable.</p>
        <p>Well then that's what I am here for.</p>
        <p>Let's start with Character Development. During character development you need to start with a character profile which is the beginning of the character's growth. The story that your creating is also the growth of the character.</p>
