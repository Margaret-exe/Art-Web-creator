        <!--What the content of the body is.-->
        <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to writing you may have struggled. Wether it's from hitting a writer's block to even knowing how to end your story or trying to make the character likeable.</p>
        <p>Well then that's what I am here for.</p>
        <p>Let's start with Character Development. During character development you need to start with a character profile which is the beginning of the character's growth. The story that your creating is the growth of the character.</p>
        <p>Start with the physical description. How old is the character? Gender? Who are they in the story? Are they a teacher, college student, or maybe a parent? What's their role and personality. </p>
        <p>When it comes to the character their backstory is essential on why they act the way that they do. Ask questions like what changed their opinions on things after a certain experience. </p>
        <p>This is basically the Moment That Everything Changed.</p>  
        <P>The Moment That Changed Everything is all about when the character was at a young age what made them think differently of the world.</P>      
        <p>For example in
